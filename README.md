## üöÄ Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. ‚úÖ Install Python

üîó https://www.python.org/downloads/

  `Add Python to PATH`
- Then click **Install Now**

To confirm Python is installed:
- Open your terminal or command prompt

### 3. ‚úÖ Install the Scrap.io Extension

Go to the Scrap.io Chrome Web Store page:

üîó https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/scrapio-google-maps-scrap/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd

Once installed, you‚Äôll need to find the extension's local path to allow the script to load it.

---

## üîç How to Find the Extension Path

1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable **Developer Mode** (top right corner)
3. Find **Scrap.io** and click **Details**
4. Copy the **Extension ID** ‚Äî it's a long string like:  
![Extension ID location](your_scrap.io_id.png)

`mjllncbijgeccmolnikpkbkpbjggcgij`
   

5. On your computer, go to the Chrome **User Data** folder:

   - **Windows:**
     ```
     C:\Users\<YourName>\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\
     ```
   - **macOS:**
     ```
     ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/
     ```
   - **Linux:**
     ```
     ~/.config/google-chrome/
     ```

6. Inside that folder, you may see one or more profiles:
   - `Default` (main profile)
   - `Profile 1`, `Profile 2`, etc. (if you use multiple Chrome users)

7. Check inside each profile's `Extensions` folder:

   **Example (Windows):**
    ```
    C:\Users<YourName>\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Profile 1\Extensions
    ```

8. Find the folder matching the Scrap.io ID (e.g. `mjllncbijgeccmolnikpkbkpbjggcgij`)

9. Open the most recent version folder inside (e.g. `1.6.4_0`)

10. Copy the **full path** of that folder (right click the folder, "Copy as path") ‚Äî this is the value to use for the `--extension-path` when running the script.

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting
